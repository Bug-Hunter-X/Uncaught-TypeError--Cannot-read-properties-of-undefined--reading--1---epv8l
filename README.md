This bug demonstrates an example of an Uncaught TypeError in JavaScript that is not immediately obvious. The problem lies in how the function `foo` is called.  When called with only one argument, the second argument, `b`, is undefined leading to an error during the addition operation (`a+b`). The solution demonstrates how to handle missing arguments in a more robust way using either default parameters or optional parameters.  This example highlights the importance of careful parameter handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected errors.
